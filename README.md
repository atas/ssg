# Ata's SSG - A PHP-based Static Site Generator for GitHub Pages

Harness the power of PHP to create static sites seamlessly for GitHub Pages. With Ata's SSG, there's no need to juggle complex frameworks or master new templating languages. Simply fork, configure, and deploy!

## Demo - Examples
This repo's CI deploys to: https://ssg-test.atasasmaz.com  
Production example: https://www.atasasmaz.com.

## Why Ata's SSG?

* **Basic PHP**: PHP stands as a robust templating and server-side language, eliminating the need to learn new 
  templating languages.

* **No Framework**: No learning a new frameworks or application. Familiarity with basic PHP is enough to get started. Just create your own HTML and PHP files.

* **Markdown & Beyond**: Write blog posts or create pages with Markdown. Need more complexity? Create HTML or PHP files.

* **Efficient Deployment**: Build process visits each PHP and markdown page, saves their HTML, and deploys to GitHub 
  Pages.

* **Instant Local Preview**: There is an integrated docker-based local Nginx & PHP server, just run `make dev-server` 
to Visualize your changes locally by just refreshing the page without a build process.

## Quick Start

_FYI: GitHub Pages for public repos are free, private repos require paid GitHub subscription._

ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT: Repo name** should be `github-username.github.io` if you want to use GitHub Pages subdomain. Change it 
from `ssg` while forking the repo or later in the repo settings. To use a **Custom Domain**, scroll below for its steps.

1. Fork this repository and **name the fork** as `your-github-username.github.io` if you want to use GitHub Pages as 
   `https://your-github-username.github.io` unless you use a custom domain with DNS records.


2. Go to your repo -> Settings -> Pages (on the left) and select `GitHub Actions` option in the `Source` select box,
   * Do not select Jekyll or static site options below, don't click on them.

3. Go to `Actions` tab of your repo at top, beside `Code` and `Pull requests`.

   * **Enable the Workflow**.
   * Select Deploy Website from the left column.
   * Click `Run Workflow` button on the right and click `Run Workflow` again.
   * Now Select `All workflows` on the left column and see the progress of the build process.

## Customisation of your site
* Update the `config.json`, `favicon-96.jpg` `site-icon.jpg` `site-icon-big.jpg` at `./assets/images`

* Pages: see examples in `./pages`. Page URLs are derived from the file name. `my-post.md` will be `yoursite.
  com/my-post`.

* Blog Posts: see examples in `./posts`. Post URLs are derived from `slug` key in the front matter.

* Open file `./layout/footer.php` to add your tracking code if you want, Google Analytics, Matomo (Piwik), etc.
    * If using advanced analytics, add a GDPR banner, or use analytics with anonymisation. See my blog post about
      more: https://www.atasasmaz.com/p/gdpr-friendly-analytics

* Layout changes: see `./layout` directory.   

* CSS changes: `less` is used to generate `css` files, see `./assets/styles` directory.

## Having custom PHP files to HTML

You can create any .php at root or any sub-dir. `./system` and `./layout` directories,
`post.php` and `page.php` are excluded from individual PHP to HTML generation.

`./my-custom.php` will be `yoursite.com/my-custom`  
`./my-custom-dir/my-custom.php` will be `yoursite.com/my-custom-dir/my-custom`

Omit `.php` extensions in the URLs and links, but keep them in the actual files.

## Using a Custom Domain

* Go to `your repo -> Settings -> Pages` (on the left) and select GitHub Actions option in the Source select box.
* Add a custom domain below, anything you want, you will need to access to its DNS records.
* Add below A and AAAA records for your domain name or subdomain. Official docs are here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

_FYI: You can have multiple A and AAAA records for the same domain or subdomain name._
```
A 185.199.108.153
A 185.199.109.153
A 185.199.111.153
A 185.199.110.153
AAAA 2606:50c0:8003::153
AAAA 2606:50c0:8002::153
AAAA 2606:50c0:8001::153
AAAA 2606:50c0:8000::153
```
* * If your repo name matches `your-github-username.github.io`, which you can only have one repo in this name, then 
    you can also add `your-github-username.github.io` as a CNAME record to your DNS records instead and still have a 
    custom domain, instead of the IP addresses above.

## Local Development Environment

You can spin up the docker container and let it serve the PHP site locally, without a build process. You need to 
have `docker` installed on your machine.

`cd` into the project directory

run:
```
composer update
make dev-server
```

Alternatively, if you don't have `make` installed, you can run below, and adjust the port `8001` to your liking:
```
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /workspace/system/bin/dev-server-entrypoint.sh -p 8001:80 \
    -v $(shell pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/atas/ssg-builder::latest
```

Your local php site will be running at **http://localhost:8001** with instant updates on page refresh, as PHP does.

## How to use this repo without forking

* Create your empty repo on GitHub with nothing in it, nothing.
* Clone this repo to your local.
* `cd` into this repo and run 
```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Your-Username/your-new-repo.git
git push
git remote add upstream git@github.com:atas/ssg.git
```

Now use your repo as it is. If you want to update your repo from the original repo, run
```
git checkout -b updates-from-upstream
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push
```

Then create a pull request from `updates-from-upstream` branch to `main` branch and go through it.

## Future Plans

### Caching Markdown files for performance in local env

Caching for page and post Markdowns in local environment will be added, so that the local dev env is always fast to 
navigate between urls, regardless of how many markdowns are there.

### Pagination for posts

I am a fan of continuous scrolling and not numbered pages. We can implement continuous scrolling on the homepage but 
I can't imagine if it can be helpful for sites with less than 100 posts. Even after 100 posts, it should not 
be a big problem for the page to be rendered. I am open for suggestions though.
