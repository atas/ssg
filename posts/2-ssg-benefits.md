# Benefits of SSGs

[TOC]

Web has started with static sites, then came the dynamic sites with PHP and various other server side languages. And 
now, we are going back to the static sites.

## What is a Static Site?

Static site is a website with HTML, CSS, JS files. It's not connected to a database. It's not generated on the fly.

## Why Static Sites are Popular Again?

Thanks to the CI/CD pipelines, now we can run our dynamic site codes in the build pipeline and deploy the output, 
instead of running them every single time at web servers and maintaining server-side applications that renders them.

It is inherently much easier to maintain just a website with HTML, CSS, JS files than a server-side application.
